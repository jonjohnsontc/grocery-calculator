# Drive-By Scraping Strategy

For Ralphs and Target, I'd like to visit their sites while logged into my own account, and perform a web-search for the items that I buy most frequently. I would then like to take up to the first n pages (let's say 3 for now), and save the data output from EasyScraper into a raw data folder.

It looks like searching for particular terms gives me richer search results than using the main carousel at login. I likely would need some sort of additional tool to tag and clean the coursel related scrapes
