# About

In a perfect world, products that are tracked in the application db are pulled automatically using automated browsing tools (e.g., Puppeteer) on a schedule. Scripts necessary to pull products from each grocer are tracked here.  

If any anomalies are detected in the course of automated browsing, they're sent to a notification center to be dealt with manually
